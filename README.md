# RainbowBuilder
A cool rainbow visualization using Sass (http://sass-lang.com/)

You can add more colors to the rainbow by copying the .ray div in index.html as many times as you like, then increasing the value of $total in main.scss.

You will need to compile main.scss to main.css using Sass for it to work properly.
